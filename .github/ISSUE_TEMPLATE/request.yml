        **Before filling out this form:**
        The Aether 1 project exists to maintain the original experience from The Aether that many enjoyed with the original mod. 
        We do not plan to add content to the mod that is not in the original mod, or that does not improve functionality between The Aether and Minecraft or other mods.
        Any feature ideas that do not fit this criteria should be for The Aether II.
