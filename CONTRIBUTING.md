### Getting started for programmers
We're excited to hear that you're interested in contributing to the Aether!

Before getting started, you'll need to install the latest 64-bit version of the OpenJDK 8 for your environment.
- Windows users: We **strongly** recommend you use the Hotspot OpenJDK 8 builds provided by the [AdoptOpenJDK project](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) instead of the builds provided by Oracle.
- macOS and Linux users: If you are already using a package manager, OpenJDK builds should be present in your software repositories. If not, we recommend using [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/) to install the Hotspot OpenJDK 8 builds provided by the [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) project.

We strongly recommend you use [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) when making code contributions. While other IDEs may work (in theory, anyways), support is spotty and you will often run into issues and other roadblocks. If you're not familiar with setting up IntelliJ IDEA for use with ForgeGradle projects, cpw has created a setup video which runs over a few of the basics of ForgeGradle [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfmlNiHonV0).

If you have any questions or issues, or would just like to discuss Aether development, feel free to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/yrFDeVZEwt).
