Changes

- Allow the Valkyrie Queen to be damaged by ranged projectiles.
- Rework the balance of the Sun Spirit fight. When the boss is hit by an Ice Crystal, it now remains in a brief frozen state where the player can damage it directly by conventional means. Many values are also less random or less varied based on the boss's health or have been rebalanced in general according to the new boss behavior.
- Rework Valkyrie movement to be less floaty, allowing them to better navigate and lunge at the player in the tight corridors of the Silver Dungeon. They have also been given a cooldown for their lunge attack.
- Allow Fire Crystals to be damaged by players to reduce the projectile's lifespan.
- Rework Swet movement to be more floaty, to be more accurate to their behavior in older versions of the mod.
- Adjusted wool drops so that shearing a puffed Sheepuff will drop one extra wool block.
- Lowered blast resistance of Holystone Bricks
