# The Aether

Gilded Games presents the original Aether mod! Up to date for modern Minecraft versions and fully compatible with multiplayer. The Aether is a dimension of floating islands high in the sky, where you can begin a new survival adventure packed with new ores, mythical creatures and perilous Dungeons! All you need to do is construct a Glowstone frame and add water to light the mystical portal, and once you step in you’ll be transported immediately to the luscious hostile paradise of the Aether! Gilded Games has ensured to maintain the Aether as close to its original state from 2011 as possible, while continuing to work on the sequel, Aether II.

### Release builds
The Aether has no stable release builds for the latest version of Minecraft just yet, but this port is in active development so keep an eye out for its eventual release.

### Bleeding edge builds
If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous or wish to help test the in-development versions, we provide **bleeding edge builds** which are produced on [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/Gilded-Games/The-Aether). These builds are created for every new commit and contain the latest available code. We do not recommend users treat these builds as releases, as they are unfinished and may contain serious issues. If you wish to download these builds, check out [this guide](https://github.com/Gilded-Games/The-Aether/wiki/CircleCI-Guide).
