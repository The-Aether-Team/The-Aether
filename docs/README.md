# The Aether

The Aether Team presents the original Aether mod! Up to date for modern Minecraft versions and fully compatible with multiplayer. The Aether is a dimension of floating islands high in the sky, where you can begin a new survival adventure packed with new ores, mythical creatures and perilous Dungeons! All you need to do is construct a Glowstone frame and add water to light the mystical portal, and once you step in you’ll be transported immediately to the luscious hostile paradise of the Aether! The Aether Team has ensured to maintain the Aether as close to its original state from 2011 as possible, while still making improvements for modern versions. The team also continues to work on the mod's sequel, [The Aether II](https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/The-Aether-II).

### Bleeding edge builds
If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous or wish to help test the in-development versions, we provide **bleeding edge builds** which are produced on [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/The-Aether-Team/The-Aether). These builds are created for every new commit and contain the latest available code. We do not recommend users treat these builds as releases, as they are unfinished and may contain serious issues. If you wish to download these builds, check out [this guide](https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/The-Aether/wiki/CircleCI-Guide).

### Packages
To install this mod through GitHub Packages in Gradle for development, you will need the [Gradle Github Packages Plugin](https://github.com/0ffz/gpr-for-gradle). To use it, make sure you have access to the Gradle plugins maven and the plugin as a buildscript dependency:

<details>
<summary> Buildscript Code</summary>

```
buildscript {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven {
        name 'Gradle'
        url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    ...
    classpath group: 'io.github.0ffz', name: 'gpr-for-gradle', version: '1.+', changing: true
  }
}
...
apply plugin: 'io.github.0ffz.github-packages'
```

</details>

Then you need to specify the package you want to use in your repository:

<details>
<summary> Repositories Code</summary>

```
repositories {
  ...
  maven githubPackage.invoke("The-Aether-Team/The-Aether")
}
```

</details>

Then load it through your dependencies, with `project.aether_version` specified in the `gradle.properties`:

<details>
<summary> Dependencies Code</summary>

```
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation fg.deobf("com.aetherteam.aether:aether:${project.aether_version}")
  ...
}
```
